Right now I am working on a set of tools. While I was working on the symbiants, I realized several things about my programming environment that I needed to correct. As a result of these discoveries, I have doven into a hole of holes to work with language abstraction and file systems.


The current high level task is to a file watching tool for performing actions over mirrored file systems. For example, say that there is a folder
`./src` whos contents is used as input to a function to generate the content of `./lib`. The structure of `./src` is maintained, while the content of the files and their extensions (types) are not. 



This is a functional map over a leafy tree.

so I perform this operation, I build `lib` from `src`, but now I change a single file. I don't want to compile the entire tree... if I were being totally functional here I would do that on all changes, I need to figure out which files need to be updated, and which do not.

it is a reactive framework for working with arbitrary asyncronous entities that can be mapped to trees.




Which two main programming languages are you using?
------------------
Javasript and sibilant lisp (compile to js language


Which packages, libraries and APIs are you using?
------------------
jquery, sibilant, browserify, nodejs, socketio, express

------------------

There will be further tools added to this to talk about and explore these programs, the website its self is a part of the development of this code


This link is out of date, and will be up dated... one day.

Where do you need support?
------------------
I need ideas, I am looking mostly to learn here, so if I run out of things to experiment with, I want people to tell me things to try.


And if you are feeling generous, there should be  a big shiny donate button in the corner, or a fancy *hire* button some where. 



Are you looking for team members?
------------------
Eventually. All the code will be open sourced eventually, and I am looking forward to working with others when I do this.


What language?
--------------
The language is Sibilant Lisp
