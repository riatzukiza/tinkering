# Tinkering 

Frequently I find my self creating gits for projects that don't really need them, they
are far too small to really leverage the power of git, and using git for them is a hassle.

so i have decided to compound all such projects into a single git, that will be labeled
as Tinkering, and fork off this any time a project becomes large enough for me to care about it.
