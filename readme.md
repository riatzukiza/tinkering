# Tinkering 

Frequently I find my self creating gits for projects that don't really need them, they
are far too small to really leverage the power of git, and using git for them is a hassle.

so i have decided to compound all such projects into a single git, that will be labeled
as Tinkering, and fork off this any time a project becomes large enough for me to care about it.

The idea is I just write what ever I want to write, and when ever it 
makes somthing tangable, I can move it.

This is my desk, so to speak. The filing cabinets are else where, this is where all of
my papers are strewn about and there is little to no organiziation. 
I find that organiziation kills creativity. And I am the most creative of all butterflys.
so prepare for horror.
